        description: "The Banff Upper Hot Springs is a naturally fed soaking pool and the only hot springs pool in Banff National Park. With water temperatures between 37°C and 40°C, winter is the perfect season to enjoy a soak in the rejuvenating waters of this natural wonder. The Banff Upper Hot Springs is open daily during the winter months and is just 1 hour and 30 minutes away from Calgary along the Trans-Canada Highway. Beat the crowds by going early in the morning or during weekdays. <br> Spend a relaxing day at the spa at the Kananaskis Nordic Spa, just 1 hour west of Calgary and close to Canmore. A series of outdoor pools, saunas, and steam rooms will help you relax with a process called hydrotherapy, as you cycle through each water temperature and soak the day away."

No experience is required to ride these soft inflatable tubes down dedicated tube runs with a magic carpet ready to take you back to the top of the hill. The WinSport Tube Park is the largest of its kind in Western Canada and is easily accessible from the Frank King Day Lodge, with washrooms, food, and other amenities accessible nearby. The Sunny Tube Park at the Lake Louise Ski Resort and Mount Norquay Ski Resort are a great way to experience the thrill of tubing in the Canadian Rockies."
